It"s a time to eat delicious food, spend time with friends and family, exchange gifts, and give back to those less fortunate. However, it is easy to get caught up in the excitement of the holidays and forget that not only are your electricity bills rising, so are your impacts on the environment. So this year, why not try making it an eco-friendly holiday season? One of the best ways to be eco-friendly during the holidays is to be wary of your decorations. Look for decorations that use LED lights, which use up to 90% less energy than traditional light bulbs. While it is always fun to be festive, not putting up Christmas lights two weeks before Thanksgiving is an easy way to lower your environmental impact. In similar fashion, don"t wait until a month after Christmas ends to take them down either! If you are celebrating Chanukkah, a traditional candle burning menorah is better for then environment than an electric model. Popcorn strings are a traditional and old-fashioned Christmas decoration, and they are actually very environmentally friendly; not only do they not use electricity, they are biodegradable! If you are preparing a large meal for your family during the holidays, there are many ways to remain environmentally friendly. It is always best to look for locally sourced foods, which avoid the pollution that comes from moving the food long distances. It is also best to use cloth napkins and real silverware rather than paper or plastic variety, which end up in landfills the next day. holiday wrapping paper Will you be sending cards and giving gifts? You can green up those traditions too.  Look for cards and paper printed on recycled paper with soy ink.  If you have kids, get them involved in making wrapping paper by decorating cut-open paper grocery bags or other leftover paper.  Or, wrap a gift in another gift: a pretty scarf, a t-shirt, a decorative and reusable box, even holiday-themed fabric that can be reused all make great wrapping materials. The holidays are an important time of year to celebrate with loved ones and cherish what is truly important. Our environment is one of those truly important things.  Treat it gently, even during the holidays, because it can only withstand so much damage. I hope everyone has a happy holiday and a healthy New Year.', 1);

Wanting to change up your routine?  Instead of wasting time, would you be interested in making a difference with your commute?  Making your commute eco-friendly is the answer to all three of these questions.  With so many available options to people across the globe, anyone has the potential to make a difference by greening their commute.  From bicycling to buses to even rowing on local waterways, there"s an option out there that can fit any situation and, even more important, any budget.  Greening your commute benefits more than the environment: you may end up incorporating additional personal exercise to your days and improving your overall quality of life.  So take the leap and create an ambitious new commute! Bus Commute The first step in taking on the green commute challenge is exploring the options.  Most individuals first consider biking, public transportation, and car-pooling.  These are all wonderful options and are often widely available.  Biking will push you to spend time outside and will produce happy endorphins in the brain that will propel you through the workday.  Public transit is a cheaper option in comparison to driving, with gas prices constantly on the rise, and using public transportation will allow you to interact with others in your community.  Who knows, you may meet your new best friend on the bus! Car-pooling also encourages human interaction and will give you an opportunity to get to know your co-workers.  This option might be especially helpful if you have just relocated to a new city.  Suggesting a carpool could help to cultivate new friendships at work. If driving to work alone in a conventional car is your only option, there are still ways to reduce your impact on the environment even if you can"t afford to buy a new hybrid or electric car.  Rush hour is not enjoyable for anyone, so if your job offers flextime, take it!  Driving in traffic creates internal tension and wastes precious gas.  If your employer offers a telecommuting option, even better! You can avoid commuting altogether for at least part of the week. Running errands?  Try combining your stops by creating a plan of attack.  The US Department of Energy stated that a cold vehicle engine uses more gas than a warm engine, so hitting multiple stops in one trip will significantly reduce the amount of gas used, helping both your wallet and the environment.  Once at your destination, try walking to different stores or shops instead of driving from one parking lot to the next. Vehicle Tune-Up Vehicle tune-ups are not necessarily cheap, but tuning up the engine and keeping tires properly inflated will help keep your car"s gas mileage at its best and improve the overall life of your vehicle. Finally, driving like a speed demon not only endangers you and others, but it also hurts the environment! The US Department of Energy also stated that for every 5mph an individual drives over 65mph, a 7% drop in gas mileage occurs. Greening your commute will lead to a healthier environment and a happier you, while also cutting costs.  Whats not to love?', 2);

During these blackouts, factories tended to have power while homes were left in the dark. Moser and his friends pictured emergencies when homes had no power and there were limited ways to start a signal fire. Moser"s boss offered the idea of using a bottle of water to focus the sun"s rays onto dry grass to light a fire. The thought stayed with Moser and he began to play with the idea of refracting light. Refraction, as defined by Merriam- Webster, is a â€œdeflection from a straight path undergone by a light rayâ€¦ in passing obliquely from one medium (as air) into anotherâ€¦"  Moser, who has a knack for constructing household items such as wooden furniture, used refraction to create makeshift lamps for his home that would light the space during the day without electricity. The invention uses only a plastic bottle, water, a bit of bleach, and a sealing component to construct. Time to install: Moser fills a two liter plastic bottle with water. He suggests adding two capfuls of bleach to the water to inhibit algae growth and keep the water inside the bottle clear. Drilling a hole through a roof tile, Moser pushes the water bottle"s cap and neck from the inside of the home through the hole, keeping the body of the bottle inside the room. The bottle, preferably one with a black cap, is fixed into place with a polyester resin, which also inhibits leaks during rain. Refraction of sunlight through the bottled water does the rest, lighting the interior of the home. So what does Moser"s invention mean in terms of energy and costs savings? An engineer who visited Moser to measure the light produced, determined that, depending on the strength of the sun, the bottle of water produced the same amount of light as a 40 to 60 watt bulb. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change article A Litre of Light,The household will be bathed in refractive light of 60 watts on a clear day, and the water in the bottle refracts the light 360 degrees to all corners of a 40 square meter [420 square foot] room for less than a US dollar in total plus labor. Savings in electricity expenditure every month is at an average of USD $6.00 / month. The carbon footprint of manufacturing one incandescent bulb = 0.45 kg [0.99 lbs] CO2,  usage of a  50 watt light bulb running for 14 hours in daytime is still 0.77 kg [1.69 lbs] per kwh so 30 days is 16.17 kg [35.64 lbs] a month or 200 kg [440.92 lbs of CO2] a year. Compare that to Moser"s lamp, which emits zero CO2, and the benefit is obvious. Energy is also saved in the processing of the bottles as they are typically up-cycled through the community. However, to some, these benefits can mean so much more than a few dollars saved.  "There was one man who installed the lights and within a month he had saved enough to pay for the essential things for his child, who was about to be born. Can you imagine?', 1);

Composting your household waste helps to speed up the natural process of its decay through the growth of aerobic bacteria.  These aerobic bacteria eat away within your compost, and while doing so the bacteria become a type of natural heating force within the pile.  Brown materials (carbon-rich) and green materials (nitrogen-rich) are favorite food sources for the bacteria and help to keep the inner temperature of a compost pile at a higher level.  However, during the frigid winter months, this process of decay slows down.  As tenders of compost, we must do our part to help the process continue instead of waiting until spring when the weather again grows warm. For those of us who are not exactly â€œscientifically inclined, winter is imagined to be a natural pause button within the local environment.  The ground grows hard, and vegetation submits to the cold.  But compost piles don"t actually stop working during the winter, they just slow down quite a bit.  Within the center of a compost pile, where they are insulated from the cold, the aerobic bacteria are most active, keeping the center of the pile warm.  The outer layers that are exposed to the cold work less efficiently.  This proves that composting during the winter months can be done. The tender balance between the correct amount of water and air within the center of the pile is often threatened by winter precipitation.  A drenched compost pile is of no use to anyone, because too much water and too little air can wipe out the population of necessary aerobic bacteria. composting piles In order to protect and cultivate your compost pile through the winter, follow these key pieces of advice:  Cover up " By shielding the compost, you will prevent the unwanted excess precipitation from drowning out those precious aerobic bacteria. Build surrounding protection " Leaving the compost pile exposed to winter winds and drops in temperature during the night make frost a bigger possibility.  Building some sort of surrounding structure will protect the pile from the flux in temperatures and the cold winds.  Hay bales are a great option for surrounding protection because of their insulating abilities. If you already have your compost pile within a container or have created a composting hole, you"re one step ahead in the winterizing process!Layer up " In addition to the structural cover suggested before for your pile, a tarp works as an insulator to hold in the heat of the inner pile.  Think of the tarp as a pair of long johns for your compost.Pile it on " By adding more composting material to your pile in the fall before the weather fully changes, you"ll have even more insulation for the inner pile where all the decaying action is happening. Chop it up " By chopping the materials in your compost pile into smaller bits and pieces, the inner heat will travel uniformly throughout the pile. These methods will help ensure that, come spring, your compost is garden-ready!', 2);
